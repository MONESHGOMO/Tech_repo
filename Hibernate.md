## Comparison: `SELECT * FROM table` in SQL vs. Hibernate

### 1. **SQL Approach**
Using raw SQL to retrieve all records from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

This retrieves all rows and columns from the `products` table.

> **Comment:** This is a direct SQL query that is tied to a specific database and does not use object mapping.

---

### 2. **Hibernate (JPQL) Approach**
In Hibernate, you retrieve data using **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)**:

```java
List<ManageProducts> products = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT p FROM ManageProducts p", ManageProducts.class).getResultList();
```

Or using **Spring Data JPA**:

```java
@Query("SELECT p FROM ManageProducts p")
List<ManageProducts> findAllProducts();
```

> **Comment:** Hibernate queries work with entity class names instead of table names, making them independent of the actual database structure.

### 3. **Key Differences**

| Feature              | SQL (`SELECT * FROM table`)  | Hibernate (JPQL / HQL) |
|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Direct Table Query** | Uses raw table names. | Uses entity class names (object-oriented). |
| **Syntax** | Pure SQL query. | JPQL/HQL (similar to SQL but works with entities). |
| **Database Independence** | Tied to a specific database type. | Abstracted from DB, can switch databases easily. |
| **Result Type** | Returns raw data (`ResultSet`). | Returns mapped Java objects (`Entities`). |
| **Performance** | Can be optimized per DB. | Uses ORM and caching mechanisms, may be slightly slower but provides benefits like lazy loading. |
| **Flexibility** | Works well for complex queries. | Easier to work with Java objects, avoids boilerplate code. |

> **Comment:** SQL queries are database-dependent and optimized for performance, while Hibernate provides better maintainability and abstraction.

### 4. **When to Use What?**

‚úÖ **Use SQL (`SELECT *`)** when:
- You need raw data processing.
- Performance tuning with native DB optimizations.
- Executing complex queries with joins and aggregations.

‚úÖ **Use Hibernate (JPQL/HQL)** when:
- You are working with Java objects directly.
- You want database independence and portability.
- You want automatic mapping and transaction management.

> **Comment:** If you need database flexibility and object-oriented features, go with Hibernate. For raw performance and custom optimizations, SQL is better.

-- SQL: Selecting all records from a table
SELECT * FROM products;
```

```java
// Hibernate: Selecting all records using HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
String hql = "FROM Products";
List<Products> productList = session.createQuery(hql, Products.class).list();
```

## üîç Key Differences Between SQL and Hibernate (HQL)

1. **Query Language**  
   - SQL is a **relational database query language**.
   - Hibernate uses **HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**, which is **object-oriented** and works with entity objects instead of table names.

2. **Database Dependency**  
   - SQL queries are **database-specific** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).
   - HQL is **database-independent**, making it more flexible.

3. **Result Type**  
   - SQL returns a **ResultSet** (tabular format).
   - Hibernate returns a **list of objects** mapped to entity classes.

4. **Object Mapping**  
   - SQL directly interacts with **database tables**.
   - Hibernate **maps Java objects** to database tables using annotations or XML configurations.

5. **Query Optimization**  
   - Hibernate supports **automatic query optimization** with caching mechanisms.
   - SQL queries must be manually optimized for performance.

6. **Security**  
   - SQL queries are **prone to SQL injection** if not handled properly.
   - Hibernate provides **built-in protection** against SQL injection using parameterized queries.

## ‚úÖ When to Use SQL vs. Hibernate?

| Scenario            | Use SQL | Use Hibernate |
|--------------------|--------|--------------|
| Simple queries with static data | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Complex queries with joins | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (but with criteria API) |
| Need database independence | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Performance optimization with caching | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Need full control over SQL execution | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

> **üìù Note:** If your application requires **dynamic queries, caching, and database independence**, Hibernate is a better choice. However, for complex reports and optimized performance, **native SQL is preferred**.
