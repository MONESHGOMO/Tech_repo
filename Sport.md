# Cricketer Performance Tracker

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Develop a web application to track and analyze the performance of cricketers, including match data and individual statistics.

## Suggested Tech Stack

### 1. Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side scripting.
- **Bootstrap**: To make the UI responsive and visually appealing.
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulations and AJAX calls.

### 2. Backend
- **Java**: As the primary programming language for the application.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies Java web application development, making it easier to set up and manage RESTful APIs.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity, allowing Java to interact with the MySQL database.

### 3. Database
- **MySQL**: To store all the data related to players, matches, and performance metrics.

### 4. Development Tools
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development.
- **Postman**: For testing RESTful APIs during development.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control and collaboration.

### 5. Deployment
- **Apache Tomcat**: For deploying the Java web application.
- **Heroku or AWS**: For hosting the application if you want it to be accessible over the internet.

## Steps to Build the Project

### 1. Define Requirements
- Identify the key features your application should have, such as:
  - User registration and authentication (optional).
  - Adding and viewing player details.
  - Recording match details.
  - Inputting player performance for each match.
  - Viewing statistics and generating reports.

### 2. Database Design
- Plan and create the MySQL database with tables for Players, Matches, and Performance.
- Establish relationships between the tables (e.g., foreign keys).

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment
- Install Java, MySQL, and your chosen IDE.
- Set up a MySQL database and connect it to your Java application using JDBC.

### 4. Develop the Backend
- Use Spring Boot to create a RESTful API for your application.
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Adding players and matches.
  - Recording performance.
  - Retrieving statistics.

### 5. Develop the Frontend
- Create web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use Bootstrap for layout and styling.
- Implement forms for data entry (adding players, matches, and performance) and tables for displaying data.

### 6. Connect Frontend and Backend
- Use AJAX calls in JavaScript to interact with the RESTful API.
- Display player and match statistics dynamically on the frontend.

### 7. Testing
- Test the application to ensure all features work as expected.
- Use Postman to test your APIs.

### 8. Deployment
- Deploy your application on a server (like Apache Tomcat) or a cloud platform (like Heroku or AWS).

### 9. Future Enhancements (optional)
- Add features like player comparisons, historical performance trends, or notifications for upcoming matches.
