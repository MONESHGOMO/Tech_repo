I am Monesh D., an aspiring developer currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering and Technology, 

with an expected graduation in 2027. I currently have a CGPA of 8.2, and I have had the opportunity to lead a team during the Smart India Hackathon.

I gained valuable experience during a one-month internship at DOI Software as a Backend Developer Intern, where I explored the industry's operational cycle and

led the team. I am proficient in Java, Python, Spring Boot, and the Collection Framework, with a strong interest in Backend Web Development. I am passionate about

learning new technologies and am focused on pursuing a career in full-stack development. Outside of my professional life, I am an ex-professional cricketer and enjoy

gardening, watching movies, listening to healing music, and appreciating nature.
